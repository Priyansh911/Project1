   <h1>Adressing Modes</h1>
      <p>The term addressing modes refers to the way in which the operand of an instruction is specified. 
Information contained in the instruction code is the value of the operand or the address of the result/operand.</p>
<h2>Types of Adressing Modes</h2>
<h3>Immediate Mode</h3> 
<p>In this mode, the operand is specified in the instruction itself.
 An immediate mode instruction has an operand field rather than the address field.</p>
<p><strong>For Example :</strong>ADD 7, which says Add 7 to contents of accumulator. 7 is the operand here.</p>
<h3>Register Mode</h3>
<p>In this mode the operand is stored in the register and this register is present in CPU. 
The instruction has the address of the Register where the operand is stored.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\register-mode.png" width="55%" align="center"><br>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>1. Shorter instructions and faster instruction fetch.</p>
<p>2. Faster memory access to the operand(s)</p>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<p>1. Very limited address space</p>
<p>2. Using multiple registers helps performance but it complicates the instructions.</p>
<h3>Register Indirect Mode</h3>
<p>n this mode, the instruction specifies the register whose contents give us the address of operand which is in memory. 
Thus, the register contains the address of operand rather than the operand itself.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\register-indirect-mode.png" width="55%" align="center">
<h3>Direct Addressing Mode</h3>
<p>In this mode, effective address of operand is present in instruction itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Single memory reference to access data.</li>
<li>No additional calculations to find the effective address of the operand.</li>
</ul>

<div id="demo" class="collapse" >
<h3>Indirect Addressing Mode</h3>
<p>In this, the address field of instruction gives the address where the effective address is stored in memory.
 This slows down the execution, as this includes multiple memory lookups to find the operand.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\direct-addressing-mode.png" width="55%" align="center">
<h3>Displacement Addressing Mode</h3>
<p>n this the contents of the indexed register is added to the Address part of the instruction, 
to obtain the effective address of operand.</p>
<p>EA = A + (R), In this the address field holds two values, 
A(which is the base value) and R(that holds the displacement), or vice versa.</p>

<section id="Instruction Cycle">

      <h2>Instruction Cycle</h2>
<p>An instruction cycle, also known as fetch-decode-execute cycle is the basic operational process of a computer. 
This process is repeated continuously by CPU from boot up to shut down of computer.</p>
<p>Following are the steps that occur during an instruction cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch the Instruction</li>
<li>Decode the Instruction</li>
<li>Read the Effective Address</li>
<li>Execute the Instruction</li>
</ul>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\instruction-cycle.png" width="55%" align=center">
<h4>Fetch the Instruction</h4>
<p>The instruction is fetched from memory address that is stored in PC(Program Counter) and stored in the instruction register IR.</p>
<h4>Decode the Instruction</h4>
<p>The instruction in the IR is executed by the decoder.</p>
<h4>Read the Effective Address</h4>
<p>If the instruction has an indirect address, the effective address is read from the memory. Otherwise operands are directly read in case of immediate operand instruction.
</p>
<h4>Execute the Instruction</h4>
<p>The Control Unit passes the information in the form of control signals to the functional unit of CPU. 
The result generated is stored in main memory or sent to an output device.</p>

<section id="Pipelining">
<h2>Pipelining</h2>

<p>Pipelining is a technique where multiple instructions are overlapped during execution.
 Pipeline is divided into stages and these stages are connected with one another to form a pipe like structure. </p> 
<p>Instructions enter from one end and exit from another end, Pipelining increases the overall instruction throughput.</p>
<p>Each segment consists of an input register followed by a combinational circuit.
The output of combinational circuit is applied to the input register of the next segment.</p>

<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\pipelining.png" width="60%" align="center"><br>
<br>
<p>Pipeline system is like the modern day assembly line setup in factories. For example in a car manufacturing industry, huge assembly
 lines are setup and at each point, there are robotic arms to perform a certain task,</p>
</section>

<section id="I/O Processor">
<h2>Input/Output Processor</h2>
<p>An input-output processor (IOP) is a processor with direct memory access capability.
 In this, the computer system is divided into a memory unit and number of processors.</p>
<p> The IOP can fetch and execute its own instructions. These IOP instructions are designed to manage I/O transfers only.</p>

<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\inputoutput.png" width="70%" align="center">
<br><br>
<p>The CPU can act as master and the IOP act as slave processor. The CPU assigns the task of initiating operations
 but it is the IOP, who executes the instructions, and not the CPU. </p>
<p>CPU instructions provide operations to start an I/O transfer. The IOP asks for CPU through interrupt.</p>
<p>Instructions that are read from memory by an IOP are also called commands to distinguish them from instructions that are read by CPU. </p>
<p>Commands are prepared by programmers and are stored in memory. Command words make the program for IOP. 
CPU informs the IOP where to find the commands in memory.</p>

<section id="RISC&CISC">
<h2>RISC</h2>
<p>RISC makes hardware simpler by using an instruction set composed of a few basic steps for loading, evaluating
 and storing operations just like an addition command will be composed of loading data, evaluating and storing.</p>
<h4><strong>Characteristic of RISC :-</strong></h4>
<p>1. Simpler instruction, hence simple instruction decoding.</p>
<p>2. Instruction take single clock cycle to get executed.</p>
<p>3. Simple Addressing Modes.</p>
<p>4. Pipeling can be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>For Example :- </strong> Suppose we have to add two 8-bit number:</p>
<p><strong>RISC approach: </strong>Here programmer will write first load command to load data in 
registers then it will use suitable operator and then it will store result in desired location.</p>
<h2>CISC</h2>
<p>CISC makes hardware complex as a single instruction will do all loading, evaluating and storing operations
 just like a multiplication command will do stuff like loading data, evaluating and storing it.</p>
<strong>Characteristic of CISC :-</strong>
<p>1. Complex instruction, hence complex instruction decoding.</p>
<p>2. Instruction are larger than one word size.</p>
<p>3. Complex Addressing Modes.</p>
<p>4. More Data types.</p>
<p><strong>For Example :- </strong> Suppose we have to add two 8-bit number:</p>
<p><strong>CISC approach: </strong>There will be a single command or instruction for this like ADD which will perform the task.</p>
