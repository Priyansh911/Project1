  <h1>Operating System</h1>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\operating_system.jpg" width="20%" align="right">
      <p> An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources,
and it is a collection of softwares.<br>
All computers and computer-like devices require operating systems, including your laptop, tablet, desktop
, smartphone, smartwatch, and router.<br></p>

<h3><strong>Objectives of Operating System</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>To make the computer system convenient to use in an efficient manner.</li><br>
<li>To hide the details of the hardware resources from the users.</li><br>
<li>To provide users a convenient interface to use the computer system.</li><br>
<li>To manage the resources of a computer system.</li><br>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Characteristics of Operating System</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory Management : </strong> Keeps track of the primary memory, i.e. what part of it is in use by whom, what 
part is not in use, etc. and allocates the memory when a process.</li><br>
 <li><strong>Processor Management : </strong> Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process
 and deallocates the processor when it is no longer required.</li><br>
<li><strong>Device Management :</strong> Keeps track of all the devices. 
This is also called I/O controller that decides which process gets the device.</li><br>
<li><strong>File Management :</strong> Allocates and de-allocates the resources and decides who gets the resources.</li><br>
<li><strong>Security :</strong> Prevents unauthorized access to programs and data by means of passwords and other
 similar techniques.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Types of Operating System</h2><br>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\OS.png" width="60%" align="center"><br>
 <h3><strong>Batch Processing : </strong></h3>
<p>This type of operating system do not interact with the computer directly. There is an operator
 which takes similar jobs having same requirement and group them into batches.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\batchOS.jpg" width="45%" align="center">
<br><br><strong>Advantages of Batch Operating System:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It is very difficult to guess or know the time required by any job to complete. </li>
<li>Multiple users can share the batch systems</li>
</ul>
<strong>Disadvantages of Batch Operating System:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Batch systems are hard to debug.</li>
<li>The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Multiprogramming</strong></h3>
<p>Sharing the processor, when two or more programs reside in memory at the same time, is referred as multiprogramming. 
Multiprogramming assumes a single shared processor.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\multiprogramming.jpg" width="50%" align="center">
<br><br><strong>Advantages of Multiprogramming: </strong>
<ul>
<li>High and efficient CPU utilization.</li>
<li>User feels that many programs are allotted CPU almost simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Disadvantages of Multiprogramming: </strong>
<ul>
<li>CPU scheduling is required.</li>
<li>To accommodate many jobs in memory, memory management is required.</li>
</ul>

<div id="demo" class="collapse" >
<br> 
<h3><strong>Time Sharing Operating System</strong></h3>
<p>Each task has given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly.
 Each user gets time of CPU as they use single system. </p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\timesharing.jpg" width="50%" align="center">
<br><br><strong>Advantages of Time Sharing: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Each task gets an equal opportunity.</li>
<li>CPU idle time can be reduced.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Disadvantages of Time Sharing: </strong>
<ul>
<li>One must have to take care of security and integrity of user programs and data.</li>
<li>There is a problem in data communication.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Real Time  Operating System</strong></h3>
<p>Real-time systems are used when there are time requirements are very strict
 like missile systems, air traffic control systems, robots etc. </p>
<br><strong>Advantages of Real Time Operating System: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Maximum use of devices and system thus gives more output from all the resources.</li>
<li>Memory allocation is well managed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Disadvantages of Real Time: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the system resources are not good enough and they are costly as well.</li>
<li>Complex and difficult to write algorithms are used.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Distributed Operating System</strong></h3>
<p>Independent systems have their own memory unit and CPU. These are called as loosely coupled or distributed systems.
 These systems processors vary in sizes and functions </p>
<br><strong>Advantages of Distributed Operating System: </strong>
<ul>
<li>The data exchange speed is increased by using electronic mails.</li>
<li>All systems are entirely independent]et of each other.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Disadvantages of Distributed Operating System: </strong>
<ul>
<li>If the main network fails, this will stop the complete communication.</li>
<li>To establish such systems, the language which is used are not clearly and well defined still.</li>
</ul>

<section id="Process">
<h2> Process Control Block </h2>

<p>Process Control Block is a data structure that contains information of the process related to it.<br>
It is very important for process management as the data structuring for processes is done in terms of the PCB.
 It also defines the current state of the operating system.</p> <br> 


<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\PCB.jpg" width="50%" align="center"><br><br>
<h3>Structure of the Process Control Block</h3>
<p>The process control stores many data items that are needed for efficient process management. </p>

<strong>Process State</strong>
<p>This specifies the process state i.e. new, ready, running, waiting or terminated</p>
<strong>Process Number</strong>
<p>This shows the number of the particular process.</p>
<strong>Program Counter</strong>
<p>This contains the address of the next instruction that needs to be executed in the process.</p>
<strong>Registers</strong>
<p>This specifies the registers that are used by the process. They may include accumulators,
 index registers, stack pointers, general purpose registers etc.</p>
<strong>List of Open Files</strong>
<p>These are the different files that are associated with the process</p>
<strong>CPU Scheduling Information</strong>
<p>The process priority, pointers to scheduling queues etc. is the CPU scheduling information that is contained in the PCB. </p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo1" id="btn2">Read More</button>
<div id="demo1" class="collapse">

<strong>Memory Management Information</strong>
<p>The memory management information includes the page tables or the segment tables depending on the memory system used. 
</p>
<strong>I/O Status Information</strong>
<p>This information includes the list of I/O devices used by the process, the list of files etc.</p>
<strong>Location of the Process Control Block</strong>
<p>The process control block is kept in a memory area that is protected from the normal user access. 
This is done because it contains important process information. </p>
<br>
<h3>How the Stack grows</h3>
<strong>Scenario 1 : Stack is empty</strong>
<p>The stack is called empty if it doesn't contain any element inside it. At this stage, the value of variable top is -1.</p>
<strong>Scenario 2 : Stack is not empty</strong>
<p>Value of top will get increased by 1 every time when we add any element to the stack. In the following stack,
 After adding first element, top = 2.</p>
<strong>Scenario 3 : Deletion of an element</strong>
<p>Value of top will get decreased by 1 whenever an element is deleted from the stack.<br>
In the following stack, after deleting 10 from the stack, top = 1.</p>
<br>
<h3>Algorithm for PUSH operation</h3>
<p>1. Check if the stack is <strong>full</strong> or not.</p>
<p>2. If the stack is full, then print error of overflow and exit the program.</p>
<p>3. If the stack is not full, then increment the top and add the element.</p>

<h3>Algorithm for POP operation</h3>
<p>1. Check if the stack is empty or not.</p>
<p>2. If the stack is empty, then print error of underflow and exit the program.</p>
<p>3. If the stack is not empty, then print the element at the top and decrement the top.</p>

<section id="Dead Lock">
<h2>Dead Lock</h2>
<p>Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each
 process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Deadlock.PNG" width="70%" align="center">
<br>
<strong>Deadlock can arise if following four conditions hold simultaneously :-</strong><br><br>

<p><strong>Mutual Exclusion: </strong>One or more than one resource are non-sharable (Only one process can use at a time)</p>
<p><strong>Hold and Wait: </strong>: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources.</p>
<p><strong>No Preemption: </strong>A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource.</p>
<p><strong>Circular Wait: </strong>A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form.</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo2" id="btn3">Read More</button>
<div id="demo2" class="collapse">

<h4><strong>Methods for handling deadlock : </strong></h4>

<p><strong>Deadlock Avoidance</strong>It is better to avoid a deadlock rather than take measures after the deadlock has occurred. 
The wait for graph can be used for deadlock avoidance.</p>
<p><strong>Deadlock Prevention</strong>So, the system checks each transaction before it is executed to make sure it does not lead to deadlock.
 If there is even a slight chance that a transaction may lead to deadlock in the future, it is never allowed to execute.</p>
<p>Ignore the problem all together: If deadlock is very rare, then let it happen and reboot the system. 
This is the approach that both Windows and UNIX take.</p>

<hr>
<section id="Scheduling">
<h2>Process Scheduling</h2>
<p>The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process
 from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.</p>

<h3>Process Scheduling Queues</h3>
<p>The OS maintains a separate queue for each of the process states and PCBs 
of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue.</p>
<p>The Operating System maintains the following important process scheduling queues :-  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job queue :- </strong>This queue keeps all the processes in the system.</li><br>
<li><strong>Ready queue :- </strong>This queue keeps a set of all processes residing in main memory,
 ready and waiting to execute.A new process is always put in this queue.</li><br>
<li><strong>Device queues :- </strong>The processes which are blocked due to unavailability of an I/O device constitute this queue.</li>
</ul>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\scheduling.jpg" width="60%"><br><br>
<h3>Schedulers</h3>
<p>Schedulers are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways.Schedulers are of three types :-</p>
<ul>
<li>Long-Term Scheduler</li>
<li>Short-Term Scheduler</li>
<li>Medium-Term Scheduler</li>
</ul>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo3" id="btn4">Read More</button>
<div id="demo3" class="collapse"><br>
<h4><strong>Long-Term Scheduler</strong></h4>
<p>It is also called a job scheduler. A long-term scheduler determines which programs are admitted to the system for processing. 
It selects processes from the queue and loads them into memory for execution. </p>
<h4><strong>Short-Term Scheduler</strong></h4>
<p>Short-term schedulers, also known as dispatchers, make the decision of which process to execute next.
 Short-term schedulers are faster than long-term schedulers.</p>
<h4><strong>Medium-Term Scheduler</strong></h4>
<p>Medium-term scheduling is a part of swapping. It removes the processes from the memory.
 It reduces the degree of multiprogramming</p>
</div>

<hr>
<section id="Paging">
<h2>Paging</h2>
<p>1. Paging is a storage mechanism used to retrieve processes 
from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages.</p>
<p>2. The main idea behind the paging is to divide each process in the form of pages. 
The main memory will also be divided in the form of frames.</p>
<p>3. The pages can be stored at the different locations of the memory but the priority is always to find the contiguous frames or holes.</p>
<p>4. Different operating system defines different frame sizes. The sizes of each frame must be equal.</p>
<p>5. Considering the fact that the pages are mapped to the frames in Paging, page size needs to be as same as frame size.</p>
<br>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\paging.png" width="55%" align="center"><br><br>
<h3>Avantages of Paging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paging reduces external fragmentation.</li>
<li>Paging is simple to implement and efficient memory management technique.</li>
<li>Due to equal size of the pages and frames, swapping becomes very easy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages of Paging</h3>
<ul>
<li>Paging suffer from internal fragmentation.</li>
<li>Page table requires extra memory space, so may not be good for a system having small RAM.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<hr>
<section id="Segmentation">
<h2>Segmentation</h2>
<p> Segmentation is a memory management technique in which, the memory is divided into the variable size parts.
 Each part is known as segment which can be allocated to a process.</p>
<p>The details about each segment are stored in a table called as segment table.</p>
<p>Segment table contains mainly two information about segment:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Base: It is the base address of the segment</li>
<li>Limit: It is the length of the segment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operating system maintains a segment map table for every process and a list of free memory blocks along 
with segment numbers, their size and corresponding memory locations in main memory.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\segment.jpg" width="55%" align="center"><br><br>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo5" id="btn6">Read More</button>
<div id="demo5" class="collapse">
<br>
<h3>Advantages of Segmentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>No internal fragmentation</li>
<li>Average Segment Size is larger than the actual page size</li>
<li>Less overhead</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages of Segmentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>It can have external fragmentation.</li>
<li>It is difficult to allocate contiguous memory to variable sized partition.</li>
<li>Costly memory management algorithms.</li>
</ul>

<section id="FCFS">
<h2>FCFS Scheduling Algorithm</h2>
<p>It is the simplest Disk Scheduling algorithm. It services the IO requests in the order in which they arrive.
 There is no starvation in this algorithm, every request is serviced.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages </h3>
<ul>
<li>The scheme does not optimize the seek time.</li>
<li>The request may come from different processes therefore there is the possibility of inappropriate movement of the head.</li>
</ul><br>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Consider the following disk request sequence for a disk with 100 tracks 45, 21, 67, 90, 4, 50, 89, 52, 61, 87, 25</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\fcfs.png" width="45%"><br>
<br>
<p>Number of cylinders moved by the head</p>

<p>= (50-45)+(45-21)+(67-21)+(90-67)+(90-4)+(50-4)+(89-50)+(61-52)+(87-61)+(87-25)</p>

<p>= 5 + 24 + 46 + 23 + 86 + 46 + 49 + 9 + 26 + 62</p>

<p>= 376</p>
</section>
<hr>
<section id="SSTF">
<h2>SSTF Scheduling Algorithm</h2>
<p>Shortest seek time first (SSTF) algorithm selects the disk I/O request which requires the least disk arm movement 
from its current position regardless of the direction. It reduces the total seek time as compared to FCFS.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages </h3>
<ul>
<li>It may cause starvation for some requests.</li>
<li>Switching direction on the frequent basis slows the working of algorithm.</li>
</ul><br>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Consider the following disk request sequence for a disk with 100 tracks</p>
<p>45, 21, 67, 90, 4, 89, 52, 61, 87, 25</p>
<p>Head pointer starting at 50. Find the number of head movements in cylinders using SSTF scheduling.</p><br>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\sstf.png" width="45%"><br>
<br>
<p>Number of cylinders = 5 + 7 + 9 + 6 + 20 + 2 + 1 + 65 + 4 + 17 = 136</p>
