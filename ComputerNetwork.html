   <h1>Computer Network</h1>
      <p>Computer Network, two or more computers that are connected with one another 
for the purpose of communicating data electronically is called Computer Network.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\CN.png" width="70%" align="center">
<h3>Uses of Computer Network </h3>
<h4><strong>Communication and Access to Information</strong> </h4>
<p>A network allows a user to instantly connect with another user, or network, and send and receive data.</p>
<h4><strong>Resource Sharing</strong></h4>
<p>Computer Networks allow users to share files and resources.</p>
<h4><strong>Centralized Support and Administration</strong></h4>
<p>Computer Networking centralizes support, administration and network support tasks.</p>

<section id="LAN">
<h3>Local Area Network (LAN)</h3>

<p>It is also called LAN and designed for small physical areas such as an office, group of buildings or a factory. 
LANs are used widely as it is easy to design and to troubleshoot. </p> 
<p>Personal computers and workstations are connected to each other through LANs. 
We can use different types of topologies through LAN, these are Star, Ring, Bus, Tree etc.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\LAN.png" width="65%" align="center">
<h3>Characteristics of LAN</h3>
<p>1. LAN's are private networks, not subject to tariffs or other regulatory controls.</p>
<p>2. LAN's operate at relatively high speed when compared to the typical WAN.</p>
<p>3. It connects computers in a single building, block or campus, i.e. they work in a restricted geographical area.</p>
<br>
<h3>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)</h3>
<p>It was developed in 1980s.It is basically a bigger version of LAN.
 Uses the similar technology as LAN. It is designed to extend over the entire city. </p>
<p>It can be means to connecting a number of LANs into a larger network or it can be a single cable.
 It is mainly hold and operated by single private company or a public company.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\MAN.png" width"60%" align-"center">
<h3>Characteristics of MAN</h3>
<p>1. It generally covers towns and cities (50 km)</p>
<p>2. Communication medium used for MAN are optical fibers, cables etc.</p>
<p>3. Data rates adequate for distributed computing applications.</p>
<h3>Wide Area Network (WAN)</h3>
<p>It is also called WAN. WAN can be private or it can be public leased network. 
It is used for the network that covers large distance such as cover states of a country.</p>
<p>It is not easy to design and maintain. Communication medium used by WAN are PSTN or Satellite links. 
WAN operates on low data rates.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\WAN.png" width="60%" align="center">
<h3>Characteristics of WAN</h3>
<p>1. It generally covers large distances(states, countries, continents).</p>
<p>2. Communication medium used are satellite, public telephone networks which are connected by routers.</p>

<section id="Topology">
<h2>Topology</h2>
<p>A network topology is the arrangement of a network, including its nodes and connecting lines.
 There are two ways of defining network geometry: the physical topology and the logical (or signal) topology.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Topology.png" width="60%" align="center">

<h3>Mesh Topology</h3>
<p>In mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via particular channel.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Mesh.png" width="55%" align="center">
<h4>Advantages of Mesh Topology :</h4>
<p>1. It is robust.</p>
<p>2. Data is reliable because data is transferred among the devices through dedicated channels or links..</p>
<p>3. Provides security and privacy</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Mesh Topology :</h4>
<p>1. Installation and configuration is difficult.</p>
<p>2. Cost of cables are high as bulk wiring is required, hence suitable for less number of devices.</p>
<p>3. Cost of maintenance is high.</p>
<h3>Star Topology</h3>
<p>In star topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable.
 This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node. </p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Star.png" height="50%" align="center">
<h4>Advantages of Star topology :</h4>
<p>1. If N devices are connected to each other in star topology, 
then the number of cables required to connect them is N. So, it is easy to set up.</p>
<p>2. Each device require only 1 port i.e. to connect to the hub.</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Star topology</h4>
<p>1. If the concentrator (hub) on which the whole topology relies fails, the whole system will crash down.</p>
<p>2. Cost of installation is high.</p>
<p>3. Performance is based on the single concentrator i.e. hub.</p>

<div id="demo" class="collapse" >
<h3>Bus Topology</h3>
<p>Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. 
When it has exactly two endpoints, then it is called Linear Bus topology.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Bus.jpg" width="50%" align="center">
<h4>Advantages of Bus Topology</h4>
<p>It is cost effective.</p>
<p>Cable required is least compared to other network topology.</p>
<p>Easy to expand joining two cables together.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Bus Topology</p>
<p>Cables fails then whole network fails.<p>
<p>If network traffic is heavy or nodes are more the performance of the network decreases.</p>
<h3>Ring Topology</h3>
<p>It is called ring topology because it forms a ring as each computer is connected to another computer, with the last one connected to the first.
 Exactly two neighbours for each device.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Ring.png" width="50%" align="center">
<h4>Advantages of Bus Topology</h4>
<p>It is cost effective.</p>
<p>Cable required is least compared to other network topology.</p>
<p>Easy to expand joining two cables together.</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Bus Topology</h4>
<p>Cables fails then whole network fails.<p>
<p>If network traffic is heavy or nodes are more the performance of the network decreases.</p>
<h3>Tree Topology</h3>
<p>It has a root node and all other nodes are connected to it forming a hierarchy. It is also called hierarchical topology. 
It should at least have three levels to the hierarchy.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\TreeT.png" width="55%" align="center">
<h4>Advantages of Tree Topology</h4>
<p>1. Extension of bus and star topologies.</p>
<p>2. Expansion of nodes is possible and easy.</p>
<p>3. Easily managed and maintained.</p>
<h4>Disadvatages of Tree Topology</h4>
<p>1. If more nodes are added maintenance is difficult.</p>
<p>2. Heavily cabled.</p>
<p>3. Central hub fails, network fails</p>
<h3>Hybrid Topology</h3>
<p>It is two different types of topologies which is a mixture of two or more topologies.</p>
<p> <strong>For example</strong> if in an office in one department ring topology is used and in another star topology is used, 
connecting these topologies will result in Hybrid Topology.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Hybrid.png" width="50%" align="center">
<h4>Advantages of Hybrid Topology</h4>
<p>1. Reliable as Error detecting and trouble shooting is easy.</p>
<p>2. Effective.</p>
<p>3. Scalable as size can be increased easily.</p>
<h4>Disadvantages of Hybrid Topology</h4>
<p>1. Complex in design.</p>
<p>2. Costly.</p>

<h3>OSI Model</h3>
<p>OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. 
It has been developed by ISO  <strong>International Organization of Standardization</strong>, in the year 1974.</p>
<p> It is a 7 layer architecture with each layer having specific functionality to perform.
 All these 7 layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one person to another across the globe.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\OSI.png" width="50%" align="center">
<h3>Physical Layer (Layer 1) :</h3>
<p>The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. 
The physical layer contains information in the form of bits.</p>

<h3>Data Link Layer  (Layer 2) :</h3>
<p>The data link layer is responsible for the node to node delivery of the message. When a packet arrives in a network, 
it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the Host using its MAC address. <br>
The packet received from Network layer is further divided into frames depending.</p>

<h3>Network Layer (Layer 3) :</h3>
<p>Network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks. It also takes care of packet routing i.e. 
Selection of the shortest path to transmit the packet, from the number of routes available.  </p>
<p>The sender & receiver's IP address are placed in the header by network layer.</p>

<h3>Transport Layer (Layer 4) :</h3>
<p>Transport layer provides services to application layer and takes services from network layer.
 The data in the transport layer is referred to as Segments. </p>
<p>Transport layer also provides the acknowledgment of the successful data transmission 
and re-transmits the data if an error is found.</p>

<h3>Session Layer (Layer 5) :</h3>
<p>This layer is responsible for establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication and also ensures security.</p>

<h3>Presentation Layer (Layer 6) :</h3>
<p>Presentation layer is also called the Translation layer.The data from the application layer is extracted here 
and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.</p>

<h3>Application Layer (Layer 7) :</h3>
<p>At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, 
we find Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. </p>
<p> These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network.</p>

<section id="TCP">
<h2>TCP I/P Model</h2>
<p>Transmission control protocol/Internet protocol, TCP/IP is a set of  protocols governing communications among all computers on the Internet.</p>
<p>More specifically, TCP/IP dictates how information should be packaged , sent, and received, as well as how to get to its destination. </p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\TCP OSI.png" width="55%" align="center">
<h3>Application Layer</h3>
<p>Application Layer The application layer is provided by the program that uses TCP/IP for communication. 
An application is a user process cooperating with another process usually on a different host .
</p>
<p>Examples of applications include Telnet and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p>
<h3>Transport Layer</h3>
<p>The transport layer provides the end-to-end data transfer by delivering data from an application to its remote peer.
 Multiple applications can be supported simultaneously. </p>
<p>The most-used transport layer protocol is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which provides connection-oriented 
reliable data delivery.</p>
<h3>Internet Layer</h3>
<p>Internet Layer is responsible for establishment of connection to send or receive data packets between multiple users or nodes or devices or networks. 
This layer is placed on the 2nd position from bottom.</p>
<p>The Internet Layer en-routes the data packets from source to destination through the process of routing with the help routing protocols.</p>
<h3>Network Access Layer</h3>
<p>The Network Access Layer is also known as the Host-to-Host as it is responsible for performing roles 
of the Physical Layer along with the functions of Data Link Layer.</p>
<p>Network Access Layer = Data Link Layer + Physical Layer.</p>

<section id="Cable">
<h2>Network Cable</h2>
<p>Cable is the medium through which information usually moves from one network device to another.
 There are several types of cable which are commonly used with LANs.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Cable.png" width="90%" align="center">
<p>There are two sub-categories of Twisted Pair Cables as mentioned below :- </p>
<ul>
<li>Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable (UTP)</li>
<li>Shielded Twisted Pair Cable (STP)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Unshielded Twisted Cable</strong></h4>
<p> Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cables are widely used in the computer and
 telecommunications industry as Ethernet cables and telephone wires. </p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\UTP.png" width="50%" align="center">
<h4><strong>Shielded Twisted Cable</strong></h4>
<p>Shielded twisted pair is a special kind of copper telephone wiring used in some business installations. <br>
An outer covering or shield is added to the ordinary twisted pair telephone wires; the shield functions as a ground.</p>

<h2>File Transfer Protocol</h2>
<p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard Internet protocol for 
transmitting files between computers on the Internet over TCP/IP connections.</p>
<p>1. FTP is a client-server protocol that relies on two communications channels between client and server:
 a command channel for controlling the conversation and a data channel for transmitting file content. </p>
<p>2. Clients initiate conversations with servers by requesting to download a file. Using FTP, a client can upload,
 download, delete, rename, move and copy files on a server.</p>
