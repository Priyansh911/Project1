   <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
<p>Software is more than just a program code. A program is an executable code, which serves some computational purpose. 
Software is considered to be collection of executable programming code.
Software, when made for a specific requirement is called <strong>software product. </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> on the other hand, is all about developing products, using well-defined,
 scientific principles and methods. </p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\SE_product.png" width="60%" align="center">
<p><strong>Software engineering</strong> is associated with development of software product using well-defined scientific
 principles, methods and procedures. The outcome of software engineering is an efficient and reliable software product.</p>
<h4><strong>Definition by IEEE</strong></h4>
<p>The application of a systematic,disciplined,quantifiable approach to the development,operation and maintenance of software;
that is, the application of engineering to software.</p>

<section id="SDLC">
<h2>Software Development Life Cycle</h2> 
<p>The Software Development Lifecycle is a systematic process for building software that ensures the quality and correctness of the software built.
 SDLC process aims to produce high-quality software which meets customer expectations.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\SDLC.png" width="50%" align="center">
<h4><strong>Stage1: Planning and requirement analysis</strong></h4>
<p>It is performed by the seniors of the team. They work on the inputs from the customers, market surveys of the industry. 
Then senior members conduct the feasibility study in the economical, operational and technical areas.</p>
<h4><strong>Stage2: Defining Requirements</strong></h4>
<p>In this phase, the team clearly explain and document the project requirements and get them approved from the customer and market surveys.
 The whole process finished through SRS( Software Requirement Specification).</p>
<h4><strong>Stage3: Designing the Architect</strong></h4>
<p>The next phase is about to bring down all the knowledge of requirements, analysis and design of the software project.
 This phase is the product of the last two phases like inputs from the customer and requirement gathering.</p>
<h4><strong>Stage4: Developing the project</strong></h4>
<p>The actual development starts in this phase of SDLC. The implementation of design begins concerning writing code.
 High-level languages such a C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP used for coding.</p>
<h4><strong>Stage5: Testing</strong></h4>
<p>The testers purpose to search defects within the system as well as verifying whether the application performs
 as expected and according to what documented in the requirements analysis phase.</p>
<p>This cycle repeated until all the requirements tested and all the defects have fixed, and the software is ready to be shipped.</p>
<h4><strong>Stage6: Deployment and Maintenance</strong></h4>
<p>When the software tested, and no issues or error remain in the software, 
it is time to deploy to production where the customer can use the software.</p>
<p> There is usually a maintenance team that looks after any post-production problems.</p>

<section id="Waterfall">

      <h2>Waterfall Model</h2>

<p>Waterfall model referred to as a linear-sequential model. In this model, the software
 development activity classified into different phases, it is compulsory for a phase to completed before the next phase starts.
 In short, there is no overlapping in the Waterfall model.</p>

<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Waterfall-model.png" width="55%" align="center"> 
<h4><strong>1. Requirement (Software Requirement Specification)</strong></h4>
<p>Requirement Specification is an essential phase of the waterfall model. In this phase,
 all the project team along with the customer prepare the list of user requirements.
 The document that holds all the data is known as SRS.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Design </strong></h4>
<p>The design is an important stage that relies on the early stage for its proper implementation.
 The appropriate design in this stage ensures an execution in the next phase.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Implementation </strong></h4>
<p>In the coding phase, based on the algorithm or flowchart the actual coding of the software is given out. That is the 
stage where the idea and flowchart of the application physically created or materialized.</p>
<p>In this phase, systems are developed in programmes called unit and these units are integrated into the next stage.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Verification </strong></h4>
<p>If there are any defects, the software development process must move back to the design phase. 
In the design phase, changes implemented and then the following stages of coding and testing are again carried out.</p>
<h4><strong>5. Maintenance </strong></h4>
<p>When the software product delivered to the customer, then some problems come up in the customer environment.
 Those problems fixed in this phase.</p>

<div id="demo" class="collapse" >
<h4><strong>Advantages of SDLC</strong></h4>
<p>1. This model is simple to implement also the number of resources that are required for it is minimal.</p>
<p>2. The start and end points for each phase is fixed, which makes it easy to cover progress.</p>
<p>3. It gives easy to control and clarity for the customer due to a strict reporting system.</p>
<h4><strong>Disadvantages of SDLC</strong></h4>
<p>1. The risk factor is higher, so this model is not good for more significant and complex projects.</p>
<p>2. This model cannot accept the changes in requirements during development.</p>
<p>3. It becomes tough to go back to the phase.</p>

<section id="RAD">
<h2>RAD Model </h2>

<p>The larger projects divided into a series of smaller projects.
 The primary features of RAD model are the reuse of templates, tools, processes, and code.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\RAD.png" width="60%" align="center">
<h4><strong>1. Business Modelling</strong></h4>
<p>This phase takes information which is gathered through several business-related sources.
 The analyst takes all the accurate info from the corporate.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Data Modelling </strong></h4>
<p>All the information is analyzed which was collected during the Business Modelling phase.
 By the analysis, the information arranged into different groups that can be beneficial for the business. 
The quality of every group of data is carefully examined and provided a precise description.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Process Modelling </strong></h4>
<p>The Process Modelling phase is the step where all the groups of information gathered throughout 
the Data Modelling step and changed into the required valuable information.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Application Generation </strong></h4>
<p>all the information which we gathered is coded, and the system is built, which is going to be utilized to create the prototype.</p>
<h4><strong>5. Testing & Turnover</strong></h4>
<p>In this phase, every prototype individually tested so that components
 can quickly be recognized and shifted to develop the most potent product.</p>

<h4><strong>Advantages of RAD</strong></h4>
<p>1. This model is flexible for change.</p>
<p>2. Each phase in RAD brings highest priority functionality to the customer.</p>
<p>3. It reduced development time.</p>
<h4><strong>Disadvantages of RAD</strong></h4>
<p>1. It required highly skilled designers.</p>
<p>2. All application is not compatible with RAD.</p>
<p>3. For smaller projects, we cannot use the RAD model.</p>

<section id="Spiral">
<h2>Spiral Model</h2>
<p>The Spiral Model is one of the most essential Software Development Life Cycle models,
Every loop of the spiral is known as Phase of the software development process. The exact number of phases required to
 develop the product can change by the project manager depending upon the project risks.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Spiral-Model.png" width="60%" align="center">
<p><strong>The various phases of Spiral model are as follows:</strong></p>
<h4><strong>1. Planning</strong></h4>
<p> In this phase, classifying of the system requirements and unit requirements are done. 
By continuing communication between the customer and the analyst.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Design </strong></h4>
<p>The design phase starts from the base and includes the architectural, logical design of modules,
 physical product design and final design in a continuous spiral.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Construct or build</strong></h4>
<p> In every spiral, construct refers to the development of the final software product. In the spiral, when the product just imagined 
and the design is developed, a Proof of Concept is developed to get the user's feedback.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Evaluation and Risk analysis</strong></h4>
<p>The risk analysis phase includes  estimating and observing technical feasibility. When testing the build, at the starting of the first creation, 
the user evaluates the software and provides feedback. 
Based on the client assessment , the method of repetition in the spiral model runs with the software throughout life.</p>

<h4><strong>Advantages of Spiral Model</strong></h4>
<p>1. Highly flexible Model.</p>
<p>2. Focus on Documentation Control.</p>
<p>3. Fast and cost-effective development.</p>
<h4><strong>Disadvantages of Spiral Model</strong></h4>
<p>1. Not a perfect fit for less or low-risk projects.</p>
<p>2. Success may depend hugely on the risk analysis.</p>
<p>3. Can be expensive to implement.</p>

<section id="Incremental">
<h2>Incremental Model</h2>
<p>Incremental Model is a process of software development where requirements 
divided into multiple standalone modules of the software development cycle.
Every subsequent release of the module adds function to the previous release.
 The process continues until the complete system achieved.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Incremental-model.png" width="60%" align="center">
<p><strong>The various phases of incremental model are as follows:</strong></p>
<h4><strong>1. Requirement analysis</strong></h4>
<p>The product analysis expertise identifies the requirements. And the system functional requirements 
are understood by the requirement analysis team.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Design & Development </strong></h4>
<p>the design of the system functionality and the development method are finished with success. When software 
develops new practicality, the incremental model uses style and development phase.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Testing </strong></h4>
<p>The testing phase checks the performance of each existing function as well as additional functionality.
  The various method is used to test the behaviour of each task.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Implementation </strong></h4>
<p>Implementation phase enables the coding phase of the development system. It involves the final coding that design in the designing and development phase and tests the functionality 
in the testing phase.</p>

<h4><strong>Advantage of Incremental Model:</strong></h4>
<p>1. Errors are easy to be recognized.</p>
<p>2. Easier to test and debug</p>
<p>3. The Client gets important functionality early.</p>
<h4><strong>Disadvantage of Incremental Model:</strong></h4>
<p>1. Need for good planning.</p>
<p>2. Total Cost is high.</p>
<p>3. Well defined module interfaces are needed.</p>

<section id="Iterative">
<h2>Iterative Model</h2>
<p>In this Model, you can start with some of the software specifications and develop the first version of the software. After the first version if there is a need 
to change the software, then a new version of the software is created with a new iteration. </p>

<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Iterative-model.png" width="60%" align="center">
<h4><strong>1. Requirement gathering & analysis </strong></h4>
<p>Requirements are gathered from customers and check by an analyst whether requirements will fulfil or not.
 Analyst checks that need will achieve within budget or not.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Design</strong></h4>
<p>Team design the software by the different diagrams like Data Flow diagram, 
activity diagram, class diagram, state transition diagram, etc.</p>
<h4><strong>3.  Implementation</strong></h4>
<p>Requirements are written in the coding language and transformed into computer programmes which are called Software.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Testing</strong></h4>
<p>After completing the coding phase, software testing starts using different test methods. There are many test methods,
 but the most common are white box, black box, and grey box test methods.</p>
<h4><strong>5. Deployment</strong></h4>
<p>After completing all the phases, software is deployed to its work environment.</p>
<h4><strong>6. Review</strong></h4>
<p>After the product deployment, review phase is performed to check the behaviour and validity of the developed product.</p>
<h4><strong>7. Maintenance</strong></h4>
<p>After deployment of the software in the working environment there may be some bugs, some errors or new updates are required.</p>

<div id="demo4" class="collapse" >
<h4></strong>Advantage of Iterative Model:</strong></h4>
<p>1. Testing and debugging during smaller iteration is easy.</p>
<p>2. It is easily acceptable to ever-changing needs of the project.</p>
<p>3. Risks are identified and resolved during iteration.</p>
<h4></strong>Disadvantage of Iterative Model:</strong></h4>
<p>1. It is not suitable for smaller projects.</p>
<p>2. More Resources may be required.</p>
<p>3. Requirement changes can cause over budget.</p>
