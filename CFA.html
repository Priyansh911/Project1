<h2>Computer Overview</h2>
<p>A computer is an electronic data processing device, which accepts and stores data input,
 processes the data input, and generates the output in a required format.</p>
<h3>Functionalities of Computer:</h3>
<p>If we look at it in a very broad sense, any digital computer carries out the following five functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Step 1 - </strong> Takes data as input.</li>
<li><strong> Step 2 - </strong> Stores the data/instructions in its memory and uses them as required.</li>
<li><strong> Step 3 - </strong> Processes the data and converts it into useful information.</li>
<li><strong> Step 4 - </strong> Generates the output.</li>
<li><strong> Step 5 - </strong> Controls all the above four steps.</li>
</ul>

      <h3>Block Diagram of Computer</h3>

    <p>A computer can process data, pictures, sound and graphics.
 They can solve highly complicated problems quickly and accurately.
  performs basically five major computer operations or functions irrespective of their size and make.</p>
    <h4><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)  </strong></h4>
    <p>The ALU and the CU of a computer system are jointly known as the central processing unit. 
You may call CPU as the brain of any computer system. Makes all sorts of calculations and directs different
 parts of the computer functions by activating and controlling the operations.</p>
 <strong>1. Input</strong>
<p>This is the process of entering data and programs in to the computer system, computer
  takes as inputs raw data and performs some processing giving out processed data. </p> 
<strong>2. Storage </strong>
<p>The process of saving data and instructions permanently is known as storage. Data has to be fed into the system before 
      the actual processing starts. It provides space for storing data and instructions.  </p> 
<strong>3. Processing</strong>
<p>The task of performing operations like arithmetic and logical operations is called processing. </p> 
<strong>4. Output</strong>
<p>This is the process of producing results from the data for getting useful information.  
Similarly the output produced by the computer after processing must also be kept 
somewhere inside the computer before being given to you in human readable form.  </p>

<div id="demo" class="collapse" >

<strong>5. Control</strong>
<p>The manner how instructions are executed and the above operations are performed.
 Controlling of all operations like input, processing and output are performed by control unit.
 It takes care of step by step processing of all operations inside the computer. </p> 
<h4><strong>Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU)  </h4></strong>
<p>The actual processing of the data and instruction are performed by Arithmetic Logical Unit. The major operations performed
 by the ALU are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logic and comparison.</p>
<h4><strong>  Control Unit (CU) </h4></strong>
<p>The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the operation of the processor.
 It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic and logic unit and input and
 output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.</p>

<section id="Input">
<h3> Input Devices </h3>
<p>An input device is a hardware or peripheral device used to send data to a computer.
 An input device allows users to communicate and feed instructions and data to computers for processing, display, storage.</p>

<h3>Types of Input devices</h3>
     <h4><strong> Keyboard and Mouse</strong></h4>
<p>Input from a user and sends that data (input) to the computer.
 They cannot accept or reproduce information (output) from the computer.</p>
<h4><strong> Microphone </strong> </h4>
<p>Sound generated by an input source, and sends that sound to a computer.</p>
<h4><strong>Webcam </strong> </h4>
<p>Receives images generated by whatever it is pointed at (input) and sends those images to a computer.</p>

<div id="demo1" class="collapse">

<h3> Output Devices</h3>
<p>An output device is any device used to send data from a computer to another device or user.
 Most computer data output that is meant for humans is in the form of audio or video.</p>
<h4><strong> Moniter </strong> </h4>
<p>Receives data from a computer (output) and displays that information as text and images for users to view.
 It cannot accept data from a user and send that data to another device.</p>
<h4><strong>Projector</strong></h4>
<p>Receives data from a computer (output) and displays, or projects,
 that information as text and images onto a surface, like a wall or a screen</p>
<h4><strong>Speakers</strong></h4>
<p>Receives sound data from a computer and plays the sounds for users to hear. 
It cannot accept sound generated by users and send that sound to another device.</p>

<section id="Memory">
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\download (2).jpg" width="40%" align="right">
<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions.
 Computer memory is the storage space in the computer,
 where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. </p>
<br>
<h4>Memory is mainly of three types :- </h4>
<ul>

<li>Cache Memory</li>
<li>Primary Memory</li>
<li>Secondary Memory</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4><strong>Cache Memory </strong></h4>

<p> The Cache Memory is the volatile computer memory which is very nearest to the CPU ,
all the Recent Instructions are Stored into the Cache Memory. It is the fastest memory that
 provides high-speed data access to a computer microprocessor.<br>
Cache meaning is that it is used for storing the input which is given ,
but the Capacity of the Cache Memory is too low in compare to Memory (random access memory (RAM)) and Hard Disk.</p>
<h4><strong>Primary Memory </strong></h4>
<p>Primary memory holds only those data and instructions on which the computer is currently working. 
It has a limited capacity and data is lost when power is switched off.
 It is generally made up of semiconductor device. These memories are not as fast as registers. </p>

<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo2" id="btn3">Read More</button>
<div id="demo2" class="collapse">
<br>
<h4><strong>Secondary Memory</strong></h4>
<p>This type of memory is also known as external memory or non-volatile. It is slower than the main memory.
 These are used for storing data/information permanently. 
CPU directly does not access these memories, instead they are accessed via input-output routines.</p>

</div>
</section>

<hr>
<section id="Primary">
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\download (3).jpg" width="50%" align="right">
<h3>Primary Memory</h3>
<p>Primary memory generally smaller in size, these are designed to hold data temporarily and are internal to the computer. 
They have the fastest data access speed, and include RAM and cache memory.</p>
<br>
<h4><strong>RAM</strong></h4>
RAM(Random Access Memory) is a part of computer's Main Memory which is directly accessible by CPU.
<p> RAM is used to Read and Write data into it which is accessed by CPU randomly.
 RAM is volatile in nature, it means if the power goes off, the stored information is lost.</p>
<h4>RAM are available in two forms:-</h4>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\download (11).png" width="30%" align="Center">
<ul>
<li>SRAM(Static RAM)</li>
<li>DRAM(Dynamic RAM)</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>SRAM</strong></h4>
<p>SRAM is type of RAM thta stores data using a static method, in which the data remains constant as long 
as electric power is supplied to the memory. Because SRAM stores data statically,
 it is faster and requires less power than DRAM.</p>
<h4><strong>DRAM</strong></h4>
<p>SRAM is more expensive to manufacture than DRAM because it is built using a more complex structure.
This complexity also limits the amount of data a single chip can store, meaning SRAM chips cannot hold as
much dat as DRAM chips.</p>

<div id="demo3" class="collapse">
<br>
<h3>ROM</h3>
<p>Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of storage medium that permanently stores data
 on personal computers (PCs) and other electronic devices.<br>Because ROM is read-only, it cannot be changed ,
 it is permanent and non-volatile, meaning it also holds its memory even when power is removed.</p>
<strong>ROM are available in three forms:- </strong><br>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\download (12).png" width="30%" align="center">
<ul>
<li>Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) </li>
<li>Electrically Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM)</li>
<li>Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM)</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>PROM</strong></h4>
<p>PROM is primarily meant for smaller productions that require some initial programming. 
With PROM, the memory chips cannot be improved when they become obsolete.</p>
<h4><strong>EPROM</strong></h4>
<p>EPROM does not lose its content when the power supply is cut off and that can be erased and reused. 
EPROMs are generally employed for programs designed for repeated use. </p>
<h4><strong>EEPROM</strong></h4>
<p>EEPROM is a stable, non-volatile memory storage system that is used for storing minimal data quantities 
in computer and electronic systems and devices, such as circuit boards.</p>

<section id="Secondary">
<h3>Secondary Memory</h3>
<p>Secondary memory is where programs and data are kept on a long-term basis. Common secondary
 storage devices are the hard disk and optical disks. <br>
The hard disk has enormous storage capacity compared to main memory.
The hard disk is usually contained inside the case of a computer</p>

<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\download (1).jpg" width="35%" align="center">
<br><br>
<h4><strong>Hard Disk</strong></h4>
<p>A hard disk drive (HDD) is a non-volatile computer storage device containing magnetic disks or platters rotating at high speeds.
 It is a secondary storage device used to store data permanently, random access memory (RAM) being the primary memory device.
 <br>Non-volatile means data is retained when the computer is turned off.A hard disk drive is also known as a hard drive.

<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\printer.png" width="25%" align="right">
<h3>Printer</h3>
<p>A printer is an electromechanical device which converts the text and graphical documents from electronic
 form to the physical form.<br> Generally they are the external peripheral devices which are
 connected with the computers or laptops through a cable or wirelessly to receive input data and print them on the papers.</p>
<h4><strong>Impact Printers</strong></h4>
<p>In this hammers or pins strike against a ribbon and paper to print the text.
 This mechanism is known as electro-mechanical mechanism. They are of two types:-</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Character Printer</strong></li>
<p>Prints only one character at a time. It has relatively slower speed. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dot Matrix Printer </strong></li>
<p>It prints characters as combination of dots. 
These have a matrix of pins on the print head of the printer which form the character.<br> 
 There is a carbon between the pins & the paper. 
The words get printed on the paper when the pin strikes the carbon. There are generally 24 pins.  </p> 
<li><strong>Daisy Wheel Printer</strong></li>
<p>Daisy wheel printers print only characters and symbols and cannot print graphics.
 They are generally slow with a printing speed of about 10 to 75 characters per second.</p>
</ul>

<li><strong>Line</strong></li>
<p>The printers which print one line or character at a time such as line printers .</p>	
<ul>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\Drum.png" width="35%" align="right">
<li><strong>Drum Printer</strong></li>

<p>Drum printer had printed characters etched on a physical drum that spun around and impacted paper in specific ways. 
A series of hammers behind the paper would press the paper onto the drum at the right time, to create text on a page.</p>

</ul>
</ol>

<div id="demo5" class="collapse">
<br>
<h4><strong>Non-Impact Printers</strong></h4>
<p>There printers use non-Impact technology such as ink-jet or laser technology. 
There printers provide better quality of O/P at higher speed. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ink-Jet Printer</strong></li><br>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\inkjet.jpg" width="25%" align="center">
<p>It prints characters by spraying patterns of ink on the paper from a nozzle or jet. It prints from nozzles having very fine holes,
 from which a specially made ink is pumped out to create various letters and shapes.</p>

<li><strong>Laser Printer</strong></li><br>
<img src="C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\Desktop\collection\image slider website\img\laserP.png" width="30%" align="center">
<p>A laser printer uses a slight different approach for printing. It does 
not use ink like inkjet printers, instead it uses a very fine powder known as "Toner".</p>
